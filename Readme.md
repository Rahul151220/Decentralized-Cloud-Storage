# Decentralized Cloud Storage

## Project Title

Decentralized Cloud Storage

## Project Description

The Decentralized Cloud Storage system is a peer-to-peer cloud storage platform that leverages blockchain technology for secure file verification and payment transactions. It enables users to store, verify, and manage files transparently without relying on a centralized entity.

## Project Vision

Our goal is to create a decentralized, trustless, and efficient cloud storage ecosystem where users can securely store files, ensure data integrity, and facilitate transactions seamlessly using blockchain technology.

## Future Scope

- Implementing smart contract-based access control.
- Integrating decentralized file storage (e.g., IPFS, Arweave).
- Enabling NFT-based ownership for stored files.
- Adding a decentralized governance model for dispute resolution.
- Supporting multi-file transactions and batch uploads.

## Key Features

- **File Storage Verification**: Users can store file metadata securely on the blockchain.
- **Secure Transactions**: Payments for storage are recorded transparently on-chain.
- **Ownership Authentication**: Verifies file ownership via smart contracts.
- **Immutable Records**: Ensures files and payments remain tamper-proof.
- **User-Friendly Payments**: Allows seamless payments between storage providers and users.
- **Scalability**: Designed to integrate with decentralized storage networks in the future.
